# Connected-component labeling(CCL) algorithm based on CUDA 

This repo is made for the High Performance Computing Competition of UESTC hosted by NVIDIA and OMNISKY 2016. I implemented a paralle CCL algorithm based on CUDA platform with C++. The most basic idea is to use Union-Find and modified it to running parellel.

Here is simple document of this repo.
